          <p>
            Engage in turn-based battles featuring Action Commands: a system that requires special inputs, such as 
            timing a button press or hitting buttons in a sequence, to deal more or take less damage in battle. 
            Learn to strategize with the elemental triangle to change how much damage is dealt too by thinking about 
            elemental strengths/weaknesses. 
          </p>
          <p>
            You can even equip feathers to give you perks in battlesâ€¦ or make combat <b>MORE DIFFICULT</b> 
            if you crave the extra challenge! Numbers are kept small too to allow you to keep track of how 
            much damage different moves will do more easily in your head than traditional RPGs!
